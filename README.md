# SplitStackTextInput - Valheim Mod
### Like the descriptive title, A text input for splitting a stack of items.

Sliders kinda suck eh?

With this mod, by default, the split dialog with the slider is hidden, and instead, you will be asked to enter a value.

There is also an option in the config to make it so the text input only shows up when you right click
on the slider (this was the original behavior)

That's it. GG EZ.
